## Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I made a simple text summarizer app using Python and OpenAI GPTâ€‘4o mini API. It summarizes a text of up to 5000 words approximately into a long paragraph. In addition, it lists the five most used words (excluding stop words) and the five most used descriptive adjectives with their respective frequency. The app is available at https://lwertheimer.streamlit.app/ - Thank you!
